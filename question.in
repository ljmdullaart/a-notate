.h1 Origin

This script is written after a question apeared on Stack Exchange.

.link https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/524884/annotating-any-files

I have had this problem for a very long time, had several discussions with
friends, and tried searching relating info online. All efforts were in
vain so I decide to give a shot here.

I have lots of files that I would like to annotate. Not necessarily are
they pictures or documents, but also audio/video files. Now, I understand
that there are ways to annotate a PDF, and there are ways to add metadata
to PDF/mp3/mp4.., but those methods are not enough for me.

More specifically, when it comes to PDF files, usually I would like to
take some notes in my favorite format. The current best way I can think
of is to create another file with the same name and put them in the same
directory (or tar them together), e.g. Learn-How-to-Learn.pdf Learn-Ho
-to-Learn.pdf.note.md. However, I found this method cumbersome, for instance
it is hard to always link them together and with their names synced.

When it comes to mp3/mp4 files, I also want to link them to other files
that contain my notes. For example,

.pre
00:45:37,I would like to listen to this part again,20190610T19:03:56
01:03:55,Donald Knuth made a good point on blah blah,20190610T20:00:03
.pre

These examples go on and on.. I feel that this is very useful, and there
must be some clever solutions out there. But to my surprise, I haven't
found any! Please let me know if I should be clearer.. sincerely I would
like to have a beautiful solution. Thank you in advance!

.h1 Bugs

Everything is a feature, not a bug. My programming is perfect. 
I deny everything. I did not make any mistakes. etcetera.

Quite a lot is untested.
